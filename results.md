Results of Each Algorithm:

Djikstra's Algorithm:

        int findSingleSourceShortestPathDistance(int start, int end) 
        
            - find the shortest distance (most trustworthy path) bewteen the start and end node
            
            
        vector<int> findSingleSourceShortestPath(int start, int end)
        
            - find the shortest (most trustworthy) path between the start and end node
        
Tarjan's Algorithm:

        int numberOfStronglyConnectedComponents()
        
            - determine the number of strongly connected components in the bitcoin network
            
 Breadth First Search:
 
        bool isValid(int start, int end)
        
            - uses breadth first search to see if there is a path from the start node to the end node
