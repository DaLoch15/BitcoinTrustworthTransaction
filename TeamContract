# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We will meet twice every week, on Tuesday and Sunday. We will meet in person on one of these days, preferably Sunday, and connect through Zoom on the other day. We will be taking notes of important points discussed to reflect on later. 
2. **Assistance** 
We have created a Discord server and will be able to text, call, and share ideas though this. We will also have a groupchat on Snapchat that we will be able to use
3. **Respect** 
We will make sure that at every meeting, all of us will have the opportunity to present ideas and discuss what each person has acheived that week. We will ensure that we have a collaborative environment where everyone's ideas are respected
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will discuss work assignments of all members on Tuesdays based on individual programming strengths. When someone has not done the work for the week, they would be expected to catch up and complete their missed work by the next meeting. 
5. **Time Commitment** 
At least 3-4 hours of work by each group member is expected. We have worked out what times will work for us, and most of the work will be done on personal time after we have discussed main topics at meetings. 
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
We will try to resolve it by thinking through the problem and trying to find a solution that satisfies all parties. If certain problems start to become a common reoccurrence, we will take it up with our project mentor and let them help us figure it out.
