# BitcoinTrustworthyTransactionProject

# Project Summary
Our proposed final project was to create a class representing a bitcoin network and given two users and some conditions, ouptut a path/result.

# Code
All code files can be found in the code/ directory. To run the code:

1. Run cmake .. in the build directory. 
2. Then make main within the build directory.
3. Run ./main in the terminal and insert two integers in the command line representing the start and end user.
4. To run our test cases, make test within the build directory and run ./test in the terminal.

# Data
