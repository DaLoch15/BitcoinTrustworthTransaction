## Weekly Goals
Our weekly goal was to complete our project proposal by using our mentor's feedback from our intial proposal. We have not completed it fully yet, but we have made great progress and made all the mandatory corrections. 
## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Rohan added the necessary people to our GitHub repository, and the rest of us continued to brainstorm ideas for our second graph algorithm, and made changes to our initial proposal based on our mentor's feedback. 

## Problems Encountered 
The only problem we've really encountered so far is figuring out our second graph algorithm. We have a few ideas in mind, but we want to make sure which ever one we choose relates the most to our dataset and will show us the most useful information. 

## Plans for next week
Plans for the next couple of days is to finish our project proposal. After we complete that our goal is to read into our dataset and set up our classes. This shouldn't be too hard but is very integral to the rest of our project.

## Optional: Questions for mentor
