# Development Log (Date: 11/28/22 -- 12/2/22)

## Weekly Goals
Our weekly goals were to implement algorithms and get started with testing.
## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Siddharth worked on some functions over the break, while the rest of us met in person to work on going through code written and also writing aditional functions. We have impelmented Djikstra's algorithm for calculating the smallest distance (greatest trust) and also provided a paths with that distance. We also started writing test cases where we hit a roadblock.
## Problems Encountered 
One of the problems encountered was that we werent sure how to go about accurately testing the functions we wrote. At the end, we decided to make a bunch of smaller tests covering edge cases to ensure proper functionality.
## Plans for next week
The plans for next week are to test rest of the functions while making the code more organized.

## Optional: Questions for mentor
